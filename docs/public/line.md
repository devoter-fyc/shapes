## Lines
* Line is a module that provides support for lines.
* This is still **BASIC** , so do **_not_** use it in **PRODUCTION USE**.
## Basic usage
* To initialize a "Line",or **LENGTHED** line,use this:
```python
>>>import line
>>>a = line.Line(10)
```
* Good.You initialized a line.Now you should use it for other purposes:
```python
>>>a.len()
10
>>>len(a)
10
```
* You could use either len(x) or x.len() to get the length.
